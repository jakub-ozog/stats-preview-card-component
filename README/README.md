## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - Desktop-first workflow

  ### What I learned

  In this challenge I had a good opportunity to learn and include CSS custom properties. By using this I was able to make the whole proces easier in terms of CSS usage.
  I have also practiced button creation especially box-shadow and hover states. 

  To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

  ```css
  :root {
      --StandardWhite: #fff;
      --PaleBlue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
      --BrightBlue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
      --VeryPaleBlue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
      --DesaturatedBlue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
      --DarkBlue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
      --HoverBlue: hsl(245, 83%, 68%);
      --BodyFont: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
    }
  ```
